      <p className='Content_detailes' >
          Here we are dreaming of Unite village communities & Documenting village
          life. To help that to happen, we want to be extra clear about what it
          means to be part of the Murthy Chat community. We want you to know what
          you can expect from us, what we expect from you, and how together we can
          make Murthy Chat better for you and your community.

        To do that, we created these Terms of Service (“Terms”), our Privacy

        Community Standards (<Link to="/community-standards">community-standards</Link>) (together the “User Agreement”). Throughout the User Agreement,
        some words have specific meanings and they should be interpreted the
        same way wherever they are used. If anything is unclear, or you don’t
        understand what we’re saying – don’t hesitate to reach out. Our goal is
        to maximize transparency and understanding about how Murthy Chat works.
